                    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed
                        with
                        canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                    <h3>How are the yurts finished?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each yurt is finished with a queen size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
                        camping
                        experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
                        facilities are located inside the lodge.

                    <p>
                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light
                        layers
                        of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
